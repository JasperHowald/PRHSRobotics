           	  <p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) brings robotics teams from around the world to compete against other teams in a game chosen for that year. Teams are grouped into red team and blue team, and then have to work together against the other team of robots. Awards are given to teams that will go to the international competition, or excel in safety or inspiration.
Each individual teamâ€™s robot is designed and built by the students, so no two robots are exactly alike. Just seeing all the possible ways to achieve the objective is interesting enough.
Past challenges include Basketball, Frisbee, and a ball goal game. Teams never know what the challenge will be until it is revealed at the same time worldwide.
